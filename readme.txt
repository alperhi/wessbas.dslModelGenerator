INTRODUCTION
------------

This project contains the source code for the WESSBAS DSL Model Generator, which
builds models that comply to the WESSBAS DSL, based on CSV-formatted
user behavior information (probabilities and think times). Each resulting model
represents a WESSBAS workload model, including workload intensity,
Application Layer, Behavior Models and Behavior Mix.

Input: Behavior Models, Workload Intensity and Behavior Mix
 (Output of wessbas.behaviormodelextractor), Configuration files

Output: WESSBAS DSL instance


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

The project has been developed with the use of the following tools:

  - JDK 1.7
  - Xtext 2.5.4
  - Eclipse Modeling Tools

ACADEMIC LITERATURE
------------------  
  
Automatic extraction of probabilistic workload specifications for 
load testing session-based application systems  (Hoorn, V\"ogele, Schulz, Hasselbring, Krcmar)


PROJECT CONTENT
---------------

Additionally to the standard structure of an Eclipse project, the following
folders are included:

  - folder "configuration" contains the properties files, that are required for
    running the generator. In particular, these files demonstrate how to
    define workload intensity and Behavior Models respectively. 

  - folder "examples" contains some example input user behavior
    information, as well as several models. 

  - folder "output" contains the output files of a test run, which generally
    include a workload model (.XMI) and a graph visualization file (.DOT).


USAGE
-----

Class "net.sf.markov4jmeter.m4jdslmodelgenerator.M4jdslModelGenerator" provides
the main() method, which requires a certain set of parameters, to be passed via
command-line in a specific order. The following parameters need to be provided:

  <workloadIntensity.properties> -- path to the properties file with workload
                                    intensity definitions.

  <behaviorModels.properties>    -- path to the properties file with Behavior
                                    Models definitions.

  <xmiOutputFile>                -- path to the XMI output file.

  <graphOutputFile>              -- path to the graph output file.

An example parameter sequence (to be used in the Eclipse run configuration)
might look as follows (in one row):

-w "./examples/specj/input/workloadIntensity.properties" 
-b "./examples/specj/input/behaviorMix.txt" 
-o "./examples/specj/output/workloadmodel.xmi" 
-q false 
-s "./examples/specj/input/sessions.dat" 

Starting the application with these parameters will produce corresponding output
in the "output" folder.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES
-----------------

The source code is comprehensively commented, and most of it should be
self-explaining; all required libraries are included. 

An executable JAR archive can be easily generated by using the File->Export
option in Eclipse. Note that the configuration files have to be provided
separately with each of such JAR files.
